- name: Dexterous Manipulation
  i18n: jalpc
  gh_user: jarrekk
  repo: Jalpc
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/ur16e.webp
  desc: 
    -a: • Designed a general dynamic hybrid manipulation strategy for dynamic grasping.
    -b: • Designed specific unprecedented non-prehensile manipulation based on UR16e, including fast dynamical grasping mechanism.
    -c: • Customized double inverted pendulum model-based algorithm (MATLAB) to guide the motion planning of UR16e.
    -d: • Controlled a real UR16e with C++.

- name: Rough Terrain Ground Vehicle Control
  i18n: cpython
  gh_user: python
  repo: cpython
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/carla.jpg
  desc: 
    -a: • Implemented algorithms from scratch on CARLA simulation to build a time-aligned dataset, including collecting,
    transforming and real-time plotting sensor data.
    -b: • Implemented a CNN & LSTM based model from scratch to make motion prediction of an autonomous ground vehicle in
    urban area and arbitrary rough terrain area. The imported rough terrain map is customized on RoadRunner.
    -c: • (IN PROGRESS) Implementing a MPPI-Control based algorithm to guide the motion planning and control of the vehicle.
