  desc: 
    1: . Analyze human motion and conclude its mechanism i.e coordinate movement and compliant movement 
    2: . Analyze coordinate movement and implement it on 2-d translation and rotation motion 
    3: . Came up with a parametric optimal control algorithm used for this project 

- name: Rough Terrain Ground Vehicle Control
  i18n: cpython
  gh_user: leishi23
  repo: Rough_terrain_vehicle_control

  desc: 
    1: . Implemented algorithms from scratch on CARLA simulation to build a time-aligned dataset, including collecting, transforming and real-time plotting sensor data.
    2: . Implemented a CNN & LSTM based model from scratch to make motion prediction of an autonomous ground vehicle in urban area and arbitrary rough terrain area. The imported rough terrain map is customized on RoadRunner.
    3: . Implemented a MPPI-Control based algorithm to guide the motion planning and control of the vehicle.
