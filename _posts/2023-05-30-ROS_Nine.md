- tf package
- How to use tf package

## tf package
- tf package records the relationship between different coordinate frames within 10 seconds.
- tf records the relationship between different coordinate frames in a tree structure.

## How to use tf package
```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-meloic-turtle-tf
roslaunch turtle_tf turtle_tf_demo.launch
rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
rosrun tf view_frames
rosrun tf tf_echo /world /turtle1
rosrun rviz rviz -d 'rospack find turtle_tf' /rviturtle_rviz.rviz
```

- `rosrun` is to run a node.
- `roslaunch` is to run a launch file, i.e. a script that runs multiple nodes.
- `rosrun tf view_frames` is to generate a pdf file that shows the relationship between different coordinate frames.
- `rosrun tf tf_echo /world /turtle1` is to show the relationship between two coordinate frames. Result is 
- `rosrun rviz rviz -d 'rospack find turtle_tf' /rviturtle_rviz.rviz` is to launch rviz to see the relationship between different coordinate frames visually.
  - Change the fixed frame to `world` and add `TF` in `Add` button.
