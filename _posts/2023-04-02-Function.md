## Keypoints 

- Compiling and running a simple C++ program 
- Basic C/C++ programming workflow 
- Inside the compiler 
- How to call a function
- How to declare a function
- Head file and source file

## Hello world 

```c++
// hello_world.c
#include <stdio.h>

// Print "Hello, world!" followed by newline and exit
int main(void){
    printf("Helllo, world\n");
    return 0;
}

// Compilation command line 
$ gcc hello_world.c -std=c99 -pedantic -Wall -Wextra // or g++ -o generated_file_name target_file_name,   ex: g++ res hello_world.c
$ ./a.out
// Output 
Hello, world!
```

- **#include** is a preprocessor directive, similar to import in Python 
- **<stdio.h>** means it's defined in stdio.h(standard input output package); **.h** is "header file"
- **main** is a function, every program has exactly one main 
- **int** is the return type. Because return 0, so its return type is int. If without return, using void as return type.
- **(void)** says the main function takes no inputs/parameters. If with parameter inputs, ex: void main(int num1, int num2).
- **printf** prints a string to "standard out" (terminal)
- **\n** denotes the newline character 
- **return 0** means "program completed without error"
- **gcc** is the compiler; **hello_world.c** is the cpp file name; 
- Switches in compilation command: **-std=c99** is to use the c99 standard from 1999 year; **-pedantic -Wall -Wextra** is to get full feedback, i.e. error and warning (potential error)
- **./** is the execution sign; **.** is current directory 
- **a.out** is the compilation default file name 

## Basic C/C++ programming workflow 

- Edit file (using EMACS or VIM)
- Compile using GNUplot C compiler (gcc) to compile, link, and create excut
    - If compile-time errors reported, edit .c file and re-compile 
- Run the excutable file 
    - If run-time errors reported/detected, go back to edit step  


## Inside the compiler 

- Step 1：preprocessor 
    - Bring together all the code that belongs together 
    - Process the directives that start with #, such as #include 
        - also #define (to ensure library exists)
- Step 2：compiler 
    - Turn human-readable source code into [object code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_code) 
    - Might yield warnings and errors if mistakes are "visible" to compiler 
- Step 3：linker 
    - Bring together all the relevant object code into a single excutable file 
    - Might yield warnings and errors if relevant code is missing, naming conflicts, etc
```
many .c files --compiler--> many .o files --linker--> one excutable file 
```

## How to call a function

```c++
int add(int num1, int num2){
    int a = num1 + num2;
    return a;
}

int main(){
    int a = 10;
    int b = 20;
    int c = add(a+b);
}
```

> **_NOTE:_**  We initialize and assign value to another variable a in function add. But the a value in function add doesn't make any difference to a value in main function due to different thread, i.e the value change of parameters doesn't change the value of argument.

## How to declare a function
It's to notify compiler there is a function before defining it. With so, we can define the function seperately/later.

```c++
int max(int a, int b);

int main(){
    int a = 10;
    int b = 20;
    return max(a, b)
}

int max(int a, int b){
    return a > b ? a:b;
}
```

- We initialize and assign value to another variable a in function add. But the a value in function add doesn't make any difference to a value in main function due to different thread, i.e the value change of parameters doesn't change the value of argument.
- **a > b ? a:b**: If the argument before ? is True, then return the value before :, otherwise return the latter one.


## Head file and source file 
- Set up head file ending with .h
- Set up source file ending with .cpp
- Declare function in head file 
- Define function in source file 

```c++
// head file swap.h
# include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void swap(int a, int b);            // declare the function
```
- using namespace std means that we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library without writing "std::cout"


```c++
// source file
# include "swap.h"

void swap(int a, int b){
    int temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
    
    cout << "a = "<< a << endl;
    cout << "b = "<< b << endl;
}
```
- include the head file using "" not <>. <> is for package. 
 

```c++
// main file
# include "swap.h"
# include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    int b = 20;
    swap(a, b);
    system("pause");
    return 0;
}
```
