## ROS Client
- A client is a node that calls a service.
- Example: to spawn a turtle in turtlesim
  - cpp:
    - cpp file:
    ```cpp
    #include <ros/ros.h>
    #include <turtlesim/Spawn.h>

    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
      // Initialize the ROS system and become a node.
      ros::init(argc, argv, "turtle_spawn");
      ros::NodeHandle nh;

      // Wait for the service to appear. Otherwise, the client will stop here.
      ros::service::waitForService("/spawn");  
      // Create a service client object. Name the client as add_turtle. <> is the type of service. "/spawn" is the name of service.
      ros::ServiceClient add_turtle = nh.serviceClient<turtlesim::Spawn>("/spawn");

      // Initialize the service object. Name it as srv.
      turtlesim::Spawn srv;
      srv.request.x = 2.0;
      srv.request.y = 2.0;
      srv.request.name = "Leo";

      // Call the service.
      ROS_INGO("Call service to spawn turtle Leo [x: %0.6f, y: %0.6f, name: %s]", srv.request.x, srv.request.y, srv.request.name.c_str());
      add_turtle.call(srv); // Wait for the response from the service. If the service is not available, the client will wait forever and stop here. So, client/server is synchronous.

      // Print the service response.
      ROS_INFO("Spawn turtle successfully [name: %s]", srv.response.name.c_str());

      return 0;
    }
    ```

    - add this to CMakeLists.txt
    ```cmake
    add_executable(turtle_spawn src/turtle_spawn.cpp) ## compile the cpp file turtle_spawncpp into an executable file turtle_spawn in /rosleaning/devel/lib/learning_service/turtle_spawn
    target_link_libraries(turtle_spawn ${catkin_LIBRARIES}) ## link the executable file turtle_spawn with the libraries in catkin_LIBRARIES
    ```
    - `catkin_make` to compile the cpp file
    - source the workspace: `source devel/setup.bash`
    - `roscore` to start the master node
    - `rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node` to start the turtlesim node
    - `rosrun learning_service turtle_spawn` to start the client node


  - python:
    - python file:
    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

    import rospy
    import sys
    from turtlesim.srv import Spawn

    def turtle_spawn():
      # Initialize the ROS system and become a node.
      rospy.init_node('turtle_spawn')

      # Wait for the service to appear. Otherwise, the client will stop here.
      rospy.wait_for_service('/spawn')
      try:
          add_turtle = rospy.ServiceProxy('/spawn', Spawn)  # Create a service client object. Name the client as add_turtle. Spawn is the type of service. "/spawn" is the name of service.

          # Call the service. Input the parameters.
          response = add_turtle(2.0, 2.0, 0.0, "Leo")  # Wait for the response from the service. If the service is not available, the client will wait forever and stop here. So, client/server is synchronous.
          return response.name
      except rospy.ServiceException, e:
          print ("Service call failed: %s"%e)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
      print ("Spawn turtle successfully [name: %s]" % turtle_spawn())
    ```
    - Change the permission of the python file: `chmod +x turtle_spawn.py` or right click the file -> properties -> permissions -> allow executing file as program
