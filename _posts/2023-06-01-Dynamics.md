> **_Keypoints_**
- Newton-Euler Equations
- Lagrange Equations

## Newton-Euler Equations

### Newton Equation: **$F=ma$**

### Euler Equation: **$\tau=I\dot{\omega}+\omega \times I\omega$**

<!-- <br/><br/> -->

## Lagrange Equations
- Lagrangian: **$L=T-V$**
  - $T$: Kinetic Energy
    - If T of a rigid body, then $T=\frac{1}{2}m\dot{q}^T\dot{q}+\frac{1}{2}\omega^T I \omega$
      - $\dot{q}$: Linear velocity about translation
      - $\omega$: Angular velocity about rotation
      - Derivation:
        - First, since $RR^T=1$, $T=\frac{1}{2}m(R\dot{q})^T(R\dot{q})+\frac{1}{2}\omega^T I \omega$
        - with generalized inertia matrix $M=\begin{bmatrix}mI_3 & 0 \\ 0 & I\end{bmatrix}$ where $I_3$ is a 3x3 identity matrix and $I$ is the inertia matrix of the rigid body.
        - then $T=\frac{1}{2}{\vec{v^b}}^TM{\vec{v^b}}$ where $\vec{v^b}=\begin{bmatrix}R\dot{q} \\ \omega\end{bmatrix}$, the generalized velocity w.r.t. the body frame.
  - $V$: Potential Energy, such as gravity $-mgh$, spring, etc.
- Lagrange Equation: **$\frac{d}{dt}(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}})-\frac{\partial L}{\partial q}=Q$**
  - $Q$: Generalized Nonconservative Force (External Force), such as joint torque, etc.
  - $\frac{d}{dt}(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}})$: Generalized Inertia Force (Internal Force). Also the change rate of momentum.
  - $\frac{\partial L}{\partial q}$: Generalized Potential Force also named as conservative force, such as gravity, spring force, etc. 
  
  > **_Note_**: The generalized force is the sum of the generalized inertia force and the generalized potential force.


## Dynamics of Open-Chained Manipulator
- Rearrage terms as: **$M(\theta)\ddot{\theta}+C(\theta,\dot{\theta})\dot{\theta}+N(\theta)=\tau$**
  - $M(\theta)\ddot{\theta}$ is the inertia force, which depends on the acceleration of the joint.
  - $C(\theta,\dot{\theta})\dot{\theta}$ is the Coriolis and Centrifugal force, which depends on the angular velocity of the joint.
  - $N(\theta)$: Gravity force and any other force except the joint torque. It includes the potential force and the friction force.
  - $\tau$: Torque
