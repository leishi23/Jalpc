## Keypoints 

- Variables, assignments, data types 
- collecting input 
- arithmetic operators and precedence 


## Printing in C 

```c
// hello_world.c
#include <stdio.h>

// Print "Hello, world!" followed by newline and exit
int main(void){
    printf("Helllo, world\n");
    return 0;
}

// Compilation command line 
$ gcc hello_world.c -std=c99 -pedantic -Wall -Wextra
$ ./a.out
// Output 
Hello, world!
```

- **printf** allows for formatted printing of values, using placeholders in the format string
    - eg: 
        ```c
        printf("There are %d students in class.", 36);
        ``` 
    - **placeholders** begin with '%' and then contain additional format information regarding field size and precision, and lastly contains a character indicating the type of data to be inserted.
    - the **actual values** corresponding to place holders are listed after the format string, 36 in this case.
    - some of the most common data type place holders:
        - **d**: decimal (integer type, ld for long int)
        - **u**: unsigned (integer type that disallows negatives, lu for long unsigned)
        - **f**: floating point (float, lf for double)
        - **c**: character 
        - **s**: string 

## Variables 

```c
int num_students
```
- When declared, a variable gets a **type (int)** and **name (num_students)** 
- A variable also has a **value** that may change throughout the program's lifetime 
    - To print the value:
    ```c
    printf("There are %d students in class.", num_students);
    ```
- Variable **Type**
    - Integer types:
        - **int**: signed integer, usually stored in 32 bits.
        - **unsigned**: unsigned integer (positive integer).
        - **long**: signed integer with much greater capacity than a plain int. 
    - Floating-point (decimal) types:
        - **float**: single-precision floating point number.
        - **double**: double-precision floating point number.
    - Character type:
        - **char**: holds a 1-byte character, 'A', 'B', '$', etc.
        - chars are basically integers. 
    - Boolean type:
        - #include <stdbool.h> to use this 
        - **bool**: value can be true or false
        - Integer values can also function as bools, where **0 means false, non-0 means true**

## Assignment 
```c
num_students = 32
```
- **=** is the assignment operator, which modifies a variable's value 
- It's strongly recommend to declare and assign at the same time:
    ```c
    int num_students = 32;
    ```
    - Generally, a variable declared but not assigned has an undefined value. Such undefined value should be avoided. It may cause fails might change from run to run. **Undefined should strike fear into your heart**.
    
## Operators
- Addition: +
- Subtraction: -
- Multiplication: *
- Division: /
    - Integer division: 7/2 = 3ï¼Œ not 3.5 
- Remainder: %

### Operator precedence 
![Alt text](https://imgv2-2-f.scribdassets.com/img/document/65792011/original/dbf1fc7af5/1671106128?v=1) 
> **_NOTE:_**  
```c
int a=10;
a--;        
--a;
```
### Using const

- Put **cosnt** before the type to say a variable cannot be modified 
    ```c
    const int base = 32;
    ```
    
### Formatted input with scanf 
- The **scanf** function works similarly to the printf output function for reading formatted input: use a format string followed by the memory location we're reading into.
    ```c
    //scanf_d.c:
    int i;
    printf("Please enter an integer: ");
    scanf("%d", &i);
    printf("The value you entered is %d", i);
    ```
- The memory location you indicate should be able to accommodate this type.
- The value **scanf** returns is the number of input items assigned
    - **0**: means the input is invalid for the specified type, even if input is available.
    - **EOF (which is -1)**: means no input at all was available. (end of file)
