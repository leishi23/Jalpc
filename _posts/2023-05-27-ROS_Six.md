## ROS Server
- A server is a node that provides a service. To publish a service, a node must advertise it.
- Example: to publish a command
  - cpp:
    - cpp file:
        ```cpp
        // to excute turtle_command service, service data type is std_srvs::Trigger

        #include <ros/ros.h>
        #include <std_srvs/Trigger.h>
        #include <geometry_msgs/Twist.h>

        ros::Publisher turtle_vel_pub;
        bool pubCommand = false;

        // arg: req, res. req here is empty, res contains two variables: bool success and string message.
        bool commandCallback(std_srvs::Trigger::Request &req, std_srvs::Trigger::Response &res)
        {
            pubCommand = !pubCommand;   // initial pubCommand is false, when receive the service request, change pubCommand state. 
            res.success = true;
            res.message = "change turtle command state!";
            ROS_INFO("send turtle velocity command[%s]", pubCommand == true ? "true" : "false");
            return true;
        }

        int main(int argc, char **argv)
        {   
            //  init node
            ros::init(argc, argv, "turtle_command_server");
            ros::NodeHandle n;

            // create service server: command_service, register callback function: commandCallback. Define the service name: /turtle_command.
            //  When receive the service "/turtle_command" request, call the callback function.
            ros::ServiceServer command_service = n.advertiseService("/turtle_command", commandCallback);    //.advertiseService() is a function of NodeHandle class, is to create a service server.

            // create publisher: turtle_vel_pub, define the topic name: /turtle1/cmd_vel, define the message type: geometry_msgs::Twist, queue size: 10
            turtle_vel_pub = n.advertise<geometry_msgs::Twist>("/turtle1/cmd_vel", 10);

            ROS_INFO("ready to receive turtle command");

            ros::Rate loop_rate(10);    // set the loop rate: 10Hz
            while (ros::ok())
            {
                ros::spinOnce();    // to check the callback function queue. If there is a callback function, call it. If not, continue the while loop.
                if (pubCommand)     // if pubCommand is true, publish the velocity command
                {
                    geometry_msgs::Twist vel_msg;
                    vel_msg.linear.x = 0.5;
                    vel_msg.angular.z = 0.2;
                    turtle_vel_pub.publish(vel_msg);
                }
                loop_rate.sleep();  // sleep to keep the loop rate: 10Hz
            }

            return 0;
        }
        ```

    - CMakeLists.txt:
        ```cmake
        add_executable(turtle_command_server src/turtle_command_server.cpp) ## to compile the cpp file into executable file: turtle_command_server. src is the folder name, turtle_command_server.cpp is the cpp file name.
        target_link_libraries(turtle_command_server ${catkin_LIBRARIES})    ## to link the executable file with catkin_LIBRARIES
        ```
        also, uncomment the following line in CMakeLists.txt:
        ```cmake
        catkin_package(
        #  INCLUDE_DIRS include
        #  LIBRARIES learning_service
        CATKIN_DEPENDS geometry_msgs roscpp rospy turtlesim ## here is to add CATKIN_DEPENDS geometry_msgs roscpp rospy turtlesim
        #  DEPENDS system_lib
        )
        ```

    - `source devel/setup.bash`
    - `roscore`
    - `rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node`
    - `rosrun learning_service turtle_command_server`
    - `rosservice call /turtle_command "{}"`    // to call the service, here is to call the service "/turtle_command", "{}" is the request data, here is empty.
        
  - Python:
    ```python
        #!/usr/bin/env python
    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

    import rospy
    from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist
    import thread, time
    from std_srvs.srv import Trigger, TriggerResponse

    # global variable
    pubCommand = False
    turtle_vel_pub = rospy.Publisher('/turtle1/cmd_vel', Twist, queue_size=10)

    def command_thread():
        while True:
            if pubCommand:
                twist = Twist()
                twist.linear.x = 0.5
                twist.angular.z = 0.2
                turtle_vel_pub.publish(twist)
            time.sleep(0.1)
            
    def commandCallback(req):
        global pubCommand   # to get the global variable
        pubCommand = not pubCommand
        rospy.loginfo("Change turtle command state to " + str(pubCommand))
        # return TriggerResponse(success, message). TriggerResponse is a class, success and message are the parameters of the class
        return TriggerResponse(True, "Change turtle command state to " + str(pubCommand))

    def turtle_command_server():
        # init a node
        rospy.init_node('turtle_command_server')
        
        # rospy.Service is a class, turtle_command is the name of the service, Trigger is the type of the service, commandCallback is the callback function
        s = rospy.Service('turtle_command', Trigger, commandCallback)
        print("Waiting for command")
        
        # thread is a module, start_new_thread is a function to start multi thread (Python is usually one thread), command_thread is the thread function
        # There is no ros::spinOnce() in python, so we need to use thread to publish the command
        thread.start_new_thread(command_thread, ())
        
        # spin() simply keeps python from exiting until this node is stopped
        rospy.spin()
        
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        turtle_command_server()
    ```
    Then run the following commands:
    ```bash
    chmod 777 scripts/turtle_command_server.py
    python scripts/turtle_command_server.py or rosrun learning_service turtle_command_server.py
    ```
