### How to turn multi-dim ndarray of ndarray into list: `numpy.matrix`
```python
temp = array(array([...]), array([...])...)
x = np.matrix(temp); 
x.tolist()
```

### Python List Iteration Removal
Suppose you have a list of integers and you want to remove all elements that are less than 5:
```python
nums = [1, 4, 6, 3, 7, 2, 8]
for num in nums[:]:  # Create a shallow copy for iteration
    if num < 5:
        nums.remove(num)
```
This code attempts to remove elements less than 5 directly while iterating over the list. The problem is that removing elements shifts the positions of the subsequent elements, causing the loop to skip over elements immediately following a removed element. As a result, some elements that should be removed may not be, leading to incorrect final lists.

- a. Iterate Over a Copy of the List
You can iterate over a copy of the list, so modifications do not affect the iteration:
```python
nums = [1, 4, 6, 3, 7, 2, 8]
for num in nums[:]:  # Create a shallow copy for iteration
    if num < 5:
        nums.remove(num)
```
- b. Iterate Backwards Using Indices
Another approach is to iterate over the list in reverse order by indices, so removing elements doesn't affect the iteration of the remaining elements:
```python
nums = [1, 4, 6, 3, 7, 2, 8]
for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
    if nums[i] < 5:
        del nums[i]
```
